          <h3>Economic Issue </h3>
          <h2> <span style="color: rgb(17, 0, 255);">Inflation, Explained: Causes of Increasing in the Philippines </span> </h2>
          <p> Inflation signifies a gradual increase in prices over time, serving as a significant economic gauge<br> with far-reaching consequences for both businesses and investors. Notably, the Philippines<br> has been grappling with a surge in inflation of late. Thus, it's crucial to delve into the factors driving inflation <br>in the Philippines and analyze its potential ramifications on businesses, investors, and individuals alike.<p>
          <h2> <span style="color: rgb(17, 0, 255);">The Primary Drivers of Inflation in the Philippines</span></h2>
          <p>In the Philippines, both core inflation and headline inflation are influenced by a combination of factors. Core inflation, which excludes volatile items such as food and energy, reflects the underlying trend in prices and is often driven by sustained demand pressures and production costs. On the other hand, headline inflation, which includes all goods and services, is more susceptible to short-term fluctuations caused by external factors such as changes in global commodity prices and exchange rates. </p>
          <p>One primary driver of core inflation is demand-pull inflation, where robust consumer spending and investment activities outpace the available supply of goods and services. This can be exacerbated by expansionary monetary policies aimed at stimulating economic growth. Similarly, cost-push inflation contributes to core inflation when rising production costs, such as escalating wages or import expenses, lead producers to raise prices. </p>
          <p>Headline inflation, while influenced by similar factors, is also affected by external forces such as fluctuations in global commodity prices and exchange rates. For example, increases in oil prices can directly impact transportation and production costs, thus influencing headline inflation rates. Moreover, geopolitical events can disrupt supply chains and affect the availability and prices of imported goods, further contributing to headline inflation.<br> <cite>Seah, H. S. (2024, March 6).

              <li>Monetary policy adjustments by the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>  Between May 2022 and end-2023, the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) tightened monetary policy aggressively by raising the policy rate ten times, from a historic low of 2.0 percent to 6.5 percent, which was deemed timely and appropriate. The effects of aggressive monetary policy tightening by the BSP are aimed at achieving macroeconomic stability by controlling inflation. However, these measures can also have adverse effects on economic growth and other aspects of the economy in the short term, requiring careful consideration and balancing by policymakers.<br><cite>Seah, H.

          <p>In a briefing in Malacanang, Diokno, who attended a sectoral meeting with President Ferdinand R. Marcos Jr. Said one of the measures proposed to alleviate the impact of inflation is the distribution of PHP500 monthly cash aid for two months, amounting to about PHP26.6 billion, to about 9.3 million households across the country. By providing financial support and access to essential services, these programs help alleviate the adverse effects of rising prices on the most vulnerable segments of society.<br><cite> Gov’t to implement more measures vs. inflation.

          <p>Implementing Demand and Supply Management Measures, Wage and Fare Hike Petitions, and Pass-Through Fee Suspension under EO 41. This aims to address inflationary pressures and ensure economic stability. By stabilizing prices for key commodities like energy and water, the government helps maintain affordability for consumers. Additionally, regulating wage and fare adjustments strikes a balance between fair compensation and inflation control. Suspending pass-through fees for delivery trucks alleviates transportation costs, contributing to lower prices for goods. Overall, these measures are vital for promoting economic resilience and protecting the purchasing power of citizens while fostering a stable and conducive economic environment.<br><cite>Lo, K.
